/* Chat Component Scrolling Fix - Test Instructions */

/*
To test the fixed scrolling behavior:

1. Start the frontend with the updated RoleAwareChatAgent component
2. Navigate to a page with the chat feature
3. Send multiple messages (10+ messages) to test scrolling
4. Verify the following behaviors:

✅ Expected Behaviors (FIXED):
- Chat container maintains fixed height (500px by default)
- Messages container scrolls internally when content exceeds height
- Page itself doesn't expand or grow taller
- Auto-scroll to bottom works smoothly when new messages arrive
- Input area stays fixed at bottom of chat container
- Scroll behavior is smooth and natural

❌ Previous Issues (RESOLVED):
- Chat expanding page height infinitely
- No scrolling within chat container
- Poor UX experience with page growing

CSS Changes Made:
1. Added maxHeight and overflow: 'hidden' to main Card container
2. Enhanced messages container with proper flex constraints
3. Added flex-shrink-0 to individual message items
4. Improved auto-scroll behavior with timeout
5. Better overflow handling (overflow-y-auto, overflow-x-hidden)

The chat now behaves like a proper chat interface:
- Fixed dimensions
- Internal scrolling
- Smooth auto-scroll to new messages
- Professional UI/UX experience

// Test scenarios to verify:
const testScenarios = [
  "Send 1-3 messages - should fit in container",
  "Send 5-10 messages - should start scrolling internally", 
  "Send 15+ messages - should maintain container height and scroll smoothly",
  "Test role discovery flow - should work with proper scrolling",
  "Test long messages - should wrap properly and scroll",
  "Test rapid message sending - auto-scroll should keep up"
];

export default testScenarios;
