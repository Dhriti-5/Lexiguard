# 🔥 Firebase Google Authentication - Setup Complete!

## ✅ What Has Been Fixed

1. **Added Firebase Package** - Installed `firebase@^10.7.1` in package.json
2. **Fixed .env File** - Moved to correct location and removed duplicate API key
3. **All Required Files in Place**:
   - ✅ `src/firebase/config.js` - Firebase initialization with Google Auth
   - ✅ `src/contexts/AuthContext.jsx` - Authentication context with login/logout
   - ✅ `src/pages/Login.jsx` - Login page with Google Sign-In button
   - ✅ `src/components/ProtectedRoute.jsx` - Route protection
   - ✅ `src/components/Layout.jsx` - Navigation with user profile & logout
   - ✅ `src/App.js` - Router with protected routes

## 🚀 How to Start

1. **Start the Frontend** (if not already running):
   ```powershell
   cd c:\Users\Pc\Lexiguard\lexiguard-frontend
   npm start
   ```

2. **The app should now open at** `http://localhost:3000`

## 🔐 How Firebase Authentication Works

### Login Flow:
1. User visits any protected page (e.g., `/upload`, `/dashboard`)
2. `ProtectedRoute` checks if user is authenticated
3. If not authenticated → Redirects to `/login`
4. User clicks "Continue with Google" button
5. Google popup opens for account selection
6. After successful login → Redirects back to intended page
7. User info appears in navigation bar with profile picture

### Logout Flow:
1. Click on your profile picture/name in the navigation
2. Dropdown menu appears with "Logout" option
3. Click "Logout"
4. User is signed out and redirected to home page

## 📱 Features Included

### ✨ Desktop Features:
- User profile picture in navigation (top right)
- Dropdown menu with user info and logout button
- Profile displays first name only
- Hover effects and smooth transitions

### 📱 Mobile Features:
- User profile in mobile menu
- Full name and email displayed
- Logout button in mobile menu
- Responsive design for all screen sizes

## 🧪 Test Your Authentication

### Test 1: Login
1. Go to `http://localhost:3000/upload`
2. You should be redirected to `/login`
3. Click "Continue with Google"
4. Select your Google account
5. Should redirect back to `/upload`

### Test 2: Protected Routes
Try accessing these URLs (should require login):
- `/upload` - Upload documents
- `/results` - View results
- `/dashboard` - User dashboard

### Test 3: Public Routes
These should work without login:
- `/` - Home page
- `/about` - About page
- `/glossary` - Glossary
- `/faq` - FAQ
- `/contact` - Contact page

### Test 4: Logout
1. Click your profile picture (top right)
2. Click "Logout"
3. Should redirect to home page
4. Try accessing `/upload` again - should redirect to login

### Test 5: Profile Display
- Desktop: Check top right for profile picture/name
- Mobile: Open menu and check user section
- Verify profile picture loads correctly
- Verify email and name display correctly

## 🔍 Verify Firebase Configuration

Your Firebase config is using these credentials:
- **Project ID**: lexiguard-ce0ff
- **Auth Domain**: lexiguard-ce0ff.firebaseapp.com
- **API Key**: AIzaSyAFUpl1zk3s_w_k8f-n1hmanySNXR3m4es

Make sure in your Firebase Console:
1. Go to https://console.firebase.google.com
2. Select project "lexiguard-ce0ff"
3. Go to Authentication → Sign-in method
4. Ensure **Google** provider is **ENABLED**
5. Add authorized domains if needed:
   - `localhost` (should be there by default)
   - Your production domain (if deploying)

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Firebase not defined" error
**Solution**: Make sure you ran `npm install firebase` and restart the dev server

### Issue: Google Sign-In popup doesn't appear
**Solution**: 
- Check browser popup blocker
- Make sure Google provider is enabled in Firebase Console
- Check browser console for errors

### Issue: Profile picture not loading
**Solution**: The app has fallback logic - will show initials if picture fails

### Issue: Redirect not working after login
**Solution**: 
- Clear browser cache
- Check that `react-router-dom` is installed
- Verify all routes in `App.js`

## 📝 Code Structure

```
Authentication Flow:
App.js (Wrapper)
  └── AuthProvider (Manages auth state)
       ├── Layout (Navigation with user profile)
       └── Routes
            ├── Public Routes (/, /about, etc.)
            └── Protected Routes
                 └── ProtectedRoute Component
                      └── Protected Page (Upload, Dashboard, etc.)
```

## 🎨 UI Features

## 🔒 Security Notes

1. **Environment Variables**: Keep your `.env` file secure, never commit to Git
2. **Firebase Rules**: Set up proper security rules in Firebase Console
3. **HTTPS**: Always use HTTPS in production
4. **API Key**: The Firebase API key in .env is safe for client-side use
