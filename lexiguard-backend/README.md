# LexiGuard Backend API üõ°Ô∏è

This repository contains the backend service for **LexiGuard**, an AI-powered legal document analysis tool.
Our mission is to **democratize legal understanding** by transforming dense, jargon-filled contracts into **simple, actionable insights** for everyone.

---

## üéØ The Problem

Legal documents‚Äîfrom rental agreements to terms of service‚Äîare often incomprehensible to the average person.
This creates **information asymmetry**, where individuals unknowingly agree to unfavorable terms, exposing them to **financial and legal risks**.

---

## üí° Our Solution

The LexiGuard backend is a **cloud-native API** that serves as the ‚Äúbrain‚Äù of our application. It:

* Generates **Plain-English Summaries** of document terms and obligations.
* Performs **Risk Analysis**, flagging unfavorable or non-standard clauses with explanations.
* Powers advanced features like **Fairness Score** and **Negotiation Assistant** (via Gemini AI).

---

## üöÄ Live API Endpoint

Our production API is deployed on **Google Cloud Run** and consumed by the frontend.

**Base URL:**
